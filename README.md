EAWE Data Science Challenge 2024

# Getting started

Please create your own fork of this repository and work directly on your private fork.
At the end of the challenge we will merge your code back into this repo via pull requests.

# Folder structure

The repository has the following structure:

    .
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── src
    ├── pyproject.toml
    ├── docs
    ├── data
    │   ├── raw
    │   ├── interim
    │   └── processed
    ├── scripts
    ├── notebooks
    └── models

`src`
Store code files here.

E.g. a Python package should be stored in this folder. A sample `pyproject.toml` is included in this repo.

`pyproject.toml`
A sample Python configuration file in case source code is provided.

`docs`
Folder used to document the solution. Use this to store example notebooks, Markdown files, reStructuredText files, etc.

`data`
Here the data should be stored for local use, split into `raw`, `interim` and `processed` folders.

Please do not add data files to git. Instead a `script`, `notebook` or other method should be included that shows how to get the data, e.g. from raw to interim and then to the processed state.

`scripts`
Contains scripts of any kind, which do not fit into the source code, `src`, or `notebooks`.

`notebooks`
Store working notebooks. These are usually not curated and hence not suitable for `docs`.

`models`
Models, model weights, model configs, etc.
